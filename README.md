# Image Encryption and Compression

## Overview
This repository presents a robust solution for image encryption and decryption using Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) along with compression and decompression utilizing Huffman Coding. The combination of these techniques ensures secure transmission and storage of image data while minimizing storage space.

## Encryption & Decryption with Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)
The encryption process involves utilizing LFSR to generate a pseudo-random sequence which is then used to scramble the pixel values of the image. Decryption reverses this process by applying the inverse operation of the LFSR-generated sequence to retrieve the original image data. This technique ensures confidentiality and integrity of the image during transmission and storage.

## Compression & Decompression with Huffman Coding
Additionally, this solution implements Huffman Coding for image compression and decompression. Huffman Coding efficiently represents the image data by assigning shorter codes to frequently occurring pixel values and longer codes to less frequent ones. This reduces the size of the image file without compromising image quality, making it suitable for efficient storage and transmission.

## Usage
1. **Encryption**: Execute the encryption algorithm to encrypt the desired image using LFSR.
2. **Decryption**: Perform decryption using the same encryption key to retrieve the original image.
3. **Compression**: Utilize the compression algorithm to compress the image using Huffman Coding.
4. **Decompression**: Decompress the compressed image to retrieve the original image data.

## Security Considerations
- **Key Management**: Ensure secure generation, storage, and transmission of encryption keys to prevent unauthorized access to the encrypted image data.
- **Algorithm Strength**: Regularly assess the strength and robustness of the encryption algorithm to withstand potential cryptographic attacks.
- **Data Integrity**: Implement integrity checks such as hash functions to verify the integrity of the image data during encryption, transmission, and decryption.

## Dependencies
Ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- .NET Framework
